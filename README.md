## 'Signory', a sign language learning platform that learns by following along
Signory, a combination of sign and story, is a platform that lets you learn sign language by following along with sign language storybooks or sign language learning videos on YouTube.

Signory's web application-based service lowers the barrier to entry for sign language learning, and our platform digitally records and disseminates the unique language of sign language, contributing to linguistic diversity and cultural sustainability.

## Overview
Most of sign language learning platforms only allowed users to watch and imitate simple word-based actions through videos, and there is no way to verify whether the actions are correct.

This makes it difficult for online-based sign language learners to learn what they are supposed to do and how to do it correctly.

Recently, Nvidia launched 'Signs,' a new service offering active feedback for learning American Sign Language. However, its word-based approach currently limits the variety of vocabulary available.

Our project, ‘Signory’ offers you opportunity to learn sentence-level actions through korean sign language-based videos with subtitles, and you can also check how accurate the actions are through similarity score. It's designed to handle the full vocabulary present in any Korean subtitled video, without relying on a pre-existing list.

## Key Features
### 1. Register YouTube video-based sign language learning videos
- If there are many videos uploaded to YouTube and they have subtitles, you can use them for sign language learning. When you select a video, the AI server extracts gesture landmarks and compares them with the actual gestures to check the accuracy of the gestures during training.

### 2. Perform sign language actions for each video segment
- After selecting a video from YouTube, the video is played sentence by sentence during training, allowing you to learn sign language gestures for each sentence.

### 3. Gesture feedback via Gemini
- Users can ask Gemini for gestures with low hand language accuracy. This allows them to see the correct way to move a sentence or word, which they can follow to improve the accuracy of their sign language gestures.

```env
DB_USER=your_db_username
DB_PASSWORD=your_db_password
DB_HOST=your_db_host
DB_PORT=3306
DB_NAME=your_db_name
```

## Installation
1. Clone the repository
```
git clone thttps://github.com/GDG-on-Campus-KNU/4th-SC-Team-8-AI.git
cd your-repo-name
```

2. (Optional) Create and activate a virtual environment
```
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate      # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
```

3. Install required packages
```
